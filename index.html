            <p>
                CACAO is a decentralized music platform. Creating a new
                music industry economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Enabling artists to connect directly with their audience. 
                Allowing them to upload and take control over their music 
                without the need of intermediaries.
            </p>
            <p>
                CACAO reminds us of that time before european economies were 
                introduced to America. Remembering that pre-Columbian cultures
                used CACAO seeds as currency.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this we must always bear in mind that as long as there is
                coordination and the agreeing upon value we are enabled to
                set ourselves forth towards the building of new economies.
            </p>
            <p>
                We know of music being an artistic means of expression. We 
                have been accustomed to consume music as a free good thanks to 
                business models where music and musicians were utilized as a
                source of entertainment but mostly as attention funnels
                concentrating the audience's attention enabling businesses
                to insert ads of their selling products.

                In archaic economies such as these artists where the less
                benefited followed by their audience fellows.
            </p>
            <p>
                CACAO stands for regaining the value of music. Exploring tools
                such as IPFS and the Ethereum Blockchain enabling us to 
                experiment with decentralized solutions for storage and 
                retrieval where both users and artists may become active 
                parties of the economy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Exploring tools such as the ERC-721 standard offering us 
                the opportunity to experiment with concepts such as 
                uniqueness and transparent and equitative royalties 
                distribution.
            </p>
            <p>
                As we enter to the midst of year 2021 we have seen a rise
                in the interest of NFT technology. We have seen the pitching
                of solutions for the arts and music fair propagation. But we 
                have seen too platforms being seduced by the old ways i.e.
                endorsing already famous actors of the old archaic economies.
                Leaving the independent artists in the same place as where
                they started off once again.
